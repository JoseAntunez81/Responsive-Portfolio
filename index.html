                    <p> I am originally from Venezuela and I have been in the United States for 18 years now. 
                        My biggest challege was to learn the english languague and I am fluent in it, and spanish which is my
                        first languague.I am an individual very passionate about developing new things to make people's life 
                        better. I decided to take this course to polish the skills I have already aquired and to gain more knowledge
                        in other technologies I have not learned yet. Another reason why I am here at the bootcamp is to get more 
                        credentials to land a very good job in the IT world and eventually go my own way as an entrepreneur and create 
                        my own company where we will develop applications and websites. <br><br>
                        I am very excited about this journey and failing is not an option, I owe it to myself, my kid, and my lady. With 
                        that said I am very confident that I will do anything in my power graduate with flying colors and succeed. <br><br><br>
